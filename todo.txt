To do for the argoneut shower finding

1) Look at extendBlobMerger to see why it misses so many things. - DONE 
1a) make track joining a little more aggressive. - DONE1

2) Remove crossing muons from data sooner

3) Run over more data events, find another electron shower.

4) Develop a matching algorithm maybe based on recon'd tracks
   Maybe based on time overlap, whatever.

5) Run found shower clusters through shower reconstruction
  -> gotta either make space points or fix up start point modules

6) Run through shower reco on mc for signal and beam MC for eff, mis ID
    -> Sort out misIDs by background

7) Run over all of neutrino mode and scan the output, run over an equivalent MC production
